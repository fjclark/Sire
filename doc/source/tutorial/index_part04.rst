Part 4 - Measurement and Movement
=================================

The whole purpose of loading molecules into sire is that you can then
do things with them. Typical things you may want to do could include;

* Measuring distances, angles or torsion angles between atoms, residue or
  molecules.
* Measuring energies of molecules or subsets of molecules.
* Moving atoms, residues or molecules, e.g. by direct translation and
  rotation of parts, or even by stretching bonds or rotating angles.

This chapter will teach you to do all of the above. Since measurement
and movement are easier if you can see molecules and create graphs,
you will also learn how to visualise sire objects and data.
