    Measure and return the distance, angle, torsion angle or improper
    angle for the passed items. The items can be points in space,
    atoms, residues or any molecule view.

    If one item is passed, then it should be Bond, Angle, Dihedral
    or Improper. In this case, the ``measure()`` function of that
    item will be returned.

    If two items are passed, then the distance between them
    is returned.

    If three items are passed, then the angle between then
    is returned.

    If four items are passed, then the torsion angle between
    them is returned if ``improper_angle`` is ``False`` (the default).
    If ``improper_angle`` is ``True``, then the improper angle
    is returned.

    Note that this will take into account any periodic boundary
    conditions. The first-found space will be used to map all
    points into a minimum-image-convention box, and the measurements
    will be made from these. Set 'ignore_space=True' if you want
    to ignore the space and perform measurements without
    periodic boundary conditions.

    Args:
        item0: Any sire object that be converted to coordinates. This
               is either sire.maths.Vector, or if this is a molecule view,
               then it is the result of calling view.coordinates()
        item1: Any sire object that be converted to coordinates. This
               is either sire.maths.Vector, or if this is a molecule view,
               then it is the result of calling view.coordinates()
        item2: Any sire object that be converted to coordinates. This
               is either sire.maths.Vector, or if this is a molecule view,
               then it is the result of calling view.coordinates()
        item3: Any sire object that be converted to coordinates. This
               is either sire.maths.Vector, or if this is a molecule view,
               then it is the result of calling view.coordinates()
        improper_angle: bool. Whether or not the improper angle should
               be returned (default False, as the torsion angle
               is calculated by default between four items)
        ignore_space: bool. Whether or not to ignore any space found
               in the passed sire objects that instead to perform
               the measurements in an infinite cartesian space.

      Returns:
        measurement : Either a distance or an angle depending on the
                      number of items passed.
