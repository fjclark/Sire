/**
This pure virtual base class represents the volume of space within which a SimSystem
resides. This class provides functions that calculate the distances between CoordGroups
in this volume, and has most of the optimisation (since most of the hard-work
double distance loops occur in this class!). Key overloaded classes that inherit
Space are Cartesian, which represents infinite 3D cartesian space, and
PeriodicBox which represents a 3D periodic box.

As this class is used right in the heart of the double loop it is very important
that it is not implemented in a way that requires a lot of virtual function calls.
This means that the class is implemented to calculate the distances of all pairs of points
between two CoordGroups in a single virtual function call. The results are held
in a special matrix that can be queried via read-only, inline, non-virtual
functions, with the items ordered in memory in the same order that you would get
by iterating over all pairs (group1 in outer loop, group2 in inner loop). An advantage
of this approach is that as the distances are calculated in one go, it is possible for
the Space class to find out whether two CoordGroups are within the non-bonded cutoff
distance before any further calculation is performed.

To prevent continual reallocation, the Space class works on an already-allocated
matrix class. This is only reallocated if it is found that it is not sufficiently
large to hold the pair of CoordGroups.

As a further optimisation, the distance matrix may be populated with the interpoint
distances, or the square of the interatomic distances, or the 1 / distances
or 1 / distances^2

The inheritors of this class should be the only parts of this code where
distance calculations are calculated between and within CoordGroups. This will
allow you to change the space of the system here, and have that space used in the
rest of the code that uses CoordGroups.

This is a virtual class that is designed to be used with SharedPolyPointer.
